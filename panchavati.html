    <p>Nestled in the heart of Nashik, Maharashtra, Panchavati is a land steeped in sacred history and divine legends. Known as the "Abode of the Five Banyan Trees", it served as a serene sanctuary for Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana during their exile, as narrated in the epic Ramayana.

      "Step into Panchavati and walk in the footsteps of divinity!" Whether you're a devotee, a history enthusiast, or a curious traveler, Panchavati promises an experience that's as enriching as it is enchanting.</p>

      <h3 id="history">History</h3>
        <p>Panchavati, located in Nashik, Maharashtra, is a region of immense historical and mythological significance, deeply rooted in the epic Ramayana. The name "Panchavati" comes from the Sanskrit words "Pancha" (five) and "Vata" (banyan trees), referring to the cluster of five sacred banyan trees believed to have existed in this area.</p>
        <p>According to the Ramayana, Panchavati was the place where Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana spent a significant part of their 14-year exile. It is here that Ravana's sister, Shurpanakha, encountered Rama and Sita, leading to a series of events that ultimately resulted in the abduction of Sita by Ravana. The region is also believed to have been the setting for the construction of Lakshmana's hut and the site of several important episodes, including the battle with Maricha, who came disguised as a golden deer.</p>

          <h5> 1) Sita Gufa (Sita's Cave)</h5>
          <section>
            <div id="location_info">
         <p>
          The Sita Gufa, also spelt as Sita Gumpha or Sita Gupha, is an important location associated with the Ramayana, an epic tale crucial to the narrative of modern Hinduism. It essentially translates to the Cave of Sita, who was the wife of Rama, the protagonist of Ramayana and heir apparent to the throne of Ayodhya. Rama is sentenced to a 14-year exile into the jungles, and he eventually spends many years in Panchavati, a region in what is now Nashik, Maharashtra. Within this place is the Cave of Sita, where it is said that the evil king of Lanka, Ravana, kidnapped Sita.
            </p>
            
            <p>The cave today is a popular place for pilgrims who travel to Panchavati to get closer to the legend of the Ramayana. Located near the five sacred banyan trees in the area, you can enter the cave through the narrow staircase leading into it. Once inside, you will find an idol of Sita along with Rama and his brother, Lakshman. To the left, there is a cave with a Shiva Linga.</p>

          <section>
            <div id="location_info">
         <p>
          Nashik's Kapaleshwar Temple is sacred to Lord Shiva. Hop, skip and jump away from the iconic Ramkund, the temple is quite unusual because, like other Shiva shrine, there is no statue of Lord Nandi, the gatekeeper of Shiva. According to the legends, the temple was the place where Lord Shiva performed penance after taking a holy dip in Ramkund to wash off his sin. The reason why there's no Nandi statue in the temple is because Lord Shiva regarded Nandi as a Guru or teacher and hence, there is no Nandi to guard the Kapaleshwar Temple.
            </p>
            
            <p>To see the temple in its full pomp and show, do visit here during the Shivratri festival. Also the temple remains crowded with devotees on Monday.It is located quite close to the Ramkund, barely two kilometers away from the main bus stand. One can reach here, by taking a bus, taxi or three wheelers from anywhere in the city.</p>
